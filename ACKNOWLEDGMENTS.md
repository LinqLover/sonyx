# Acknowledgments

This project has been initial developed within the course ["Sonic Thinking - Methods of Working with Sound"](https://hpi.de/studium/im-studium/lehrveranstaltungen/it-systems-engineering-ma/lehrveranstaltung/sose-21-3286-sonic-thinking-seminar-_-methods-of-working-with-sound.html) from the [neurodesign group @ HPI](https://hpi.de/neurodesign/home.html).

Nevertheless, thanks also go out to the following people:

- **Patrick Rein** ([codeZeilen](https://github.com/codeZeilen) @ [hpi-swa](https://github.com/hpi-swa)]): experiences with approaches for source code instrumentation in Squeak/Smalltalk; implementation particularities of [Babylonian/S programming system](https://github.com/hpi-swa-lab/babylonian-programming-smalltalk) and some fixes of reported bugs; feedback to early prototypes
- **Tom Beckmann** ([tom95](https://github.com/tom95) @ [hpi-swa](https://github.com/hpi-swa)): introduction into [Sandblocks](https://github.com/tom95/sandblocks), implementation particularities, and many fixes of reported bugs
- **Julian von Thienen** ([JuliavonThienen](https://github.com/JuliavonThienen) @ [HPI Neurodesign Group](https://hpi.de/neurodesign/home.html)): guidance during the project process

- **Marcel Taeumel** ([marceltaeumel](https://github.com/marceltaeumel) @ [hpi-swa](https://github.com/hpi-swa)): feedback to early prototype
- **Irene-Sophia Plank** ([IreneSophia](https://github.com/IreneSophia) @ [HPI Neurodesign Group](https://hpi.de/neurodesign/home.html)): advice regarding user study design
- Members of the Squeak development community ([squeak-dev mailing list](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/)): implementation particularities of the Sound package for Squeak (especially Herbert König, Stéphane Rollandin, Tim Rowledge, and Marcel Taeumel)
