**sonyx** (***S***ound-based t***O***ols for u***N***derstanding of software s***Y***stems through e***X***ploration) is a toolkit to explore software systems through sonification in [Squeak/Smaltalk](https://squeak.org).
It is currently under initial development within the course ["Sonic Thinking - Methods of Working with Sound"](https://hpi.de/studium/im-studium/lehrveranstaltungen/it-systems-engineering-ma/lehrveranstaltung/sose-21-3286-sonic-thinking-seminar-_-methods-of-working-with-sound.html) offered by Julia von Thienen from the [neurodesign group @ HPI](https://hpi.de/neurodesign/home.html).

Source code is going to follow soon, stay tuned and watch the repository!
In the meantime, you can find some inspiration by having a look at the [project board](https://github.com/LinqLover/sonyx/projects/1).
