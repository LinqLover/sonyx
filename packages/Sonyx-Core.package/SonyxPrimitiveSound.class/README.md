I adapt a SonyxSound into the Squeak Sounds hierarchy that is playable by the SoundService. My first responsibility is to map all accesses to my underlying squeakSound (which is retrieved from the SonyxSound). My other responsibility is to update all properties of the SonyxSound via #doControl to enable support for parameter modulation. I also inform the SonyxSound when I am done to unlock it.
