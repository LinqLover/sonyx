I am a mock object that is used by a SonyxPreviewGenerator to substitute unknown objects in an expression. I silently ignore random requests but try to resolve them with random data when possible. This works for simple expressions but sometimes also fails. See comment of SonyxPreviewGenerator for more details.

BEWARE! I (ab)use dynamic forwarding to handle ALL requests unconditionally without raising an error, so effectively I am a black hole that absorbs any message. Be carefully when playing around with me, I am able to erade all your tools.
